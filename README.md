# Cryptocurrency ePaper Ticker 
(supports all 7000+ coins/currencies listed on [CoinGecko](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list))

An ePaper Cryptocurrency price ticker that runs as a Python script on a Raspberry Pi connected to a [Waveshare 2.7 inch monochrome ePaper display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.7inch_e-Paper_HAT). The script periodically (every 5 mins by default) takes data from CoinGecko and prints a summary to the ePaper.

A few minutes work gives you a desk ornament that will tastefully and unobtrusively monitor a coin's journey moonward.

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

(These instructions assume that your Raspberry Pi is already connected to the Internet, happily running `pip` and has `python3` installed)

If you are running the Pi headless, connect to your Raspberry Pi using `ssh`.

Install the Waveshare Python module following the instructions on their [Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.7inch_e-Paper_HAT) under the tab Hardware/Software setup.

(To install the waveshare_epd python module, you need to run the setup file in their repository - also, be sure **not** to install Jetson libraries on a Pi)

```
cd e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
## Install & Run

Copy the files from this repository onto the Pi, or clone using:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/llvllch/btcticker.git
cd btcticker
```


Install the required modules using pip:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you'd like the script to persist once you close the session, use [screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/).

Start a screen session:

```
screen bash
```

Run the script using:

```
python3 btcticker.py
```

Detatch from the screen session using CTRL-A followed by CTRL-D

The ticker will now pull data every 10 minutes and update the display. 

# Interface

The ePaper is slow. There is a lag of a few seconds between button press and a change to the display. 

Here's what the buttons do:
- Button 1: Cycle through the cryptocurrencies listed in config.yaml
- Button 2: Rotate Display -90 degrees
- Button 3: Invert Display
- Button 4: Cycle through the fiat currencies listed in config.yaml

Update frequency can be changed in the configuration file (default is 300 seconds).

# Configuration

The file `config.yaml` contains a number of options that may be tweaked:

```
display:
  cycle: true
  inverted: false
  orientation: 90
  trendingmode: false
  showvolume: false
  showrank: false
ticker:
  currency: bitcoin,ethereum,cardano
  exchange: default
  fiatcurrency: usd,eur,gbp
  sparklinedays: 1 
  updatefrequency: 300
```

## Values

- **cycle**: switch the display between the listed currencies if set to **true**, display only the first on the list if set to **false**
- **inverted**: Black text on grey background if **false**. Grey text on black background if **true**
- **orientation**: Screen rotation in degrees , can take values **0,90,180,270**
- **trendingmode**: If **true**, it checks the 7 coins that coingecko lists as trending and also displays them (names are included in display)
- **showvolume, showrank**: **true** to include in display, **false** to omit
- **currency**: the coin(s) you would like to display (must be the coingecko id)
- **exchange**: default means use coingecko price, it can also be set to a specific exchange name such as **gdax** (coinbase), **binance** or **kraken** (full list on coingecko api [page](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3)) 
- **fiatcurrency**: currently only uses first one (unless you are cycling with buttons)
- **sparklinedays**: Number of days of historical data appearing on chart
- **updatefrequency**: (in seconds), how often to refresh the display

## Trending mode

When you activate trending mode (by setting to true in the config file, in addition to your coins, the ticker will cycle through 7 coins that are currently listing as trending on CoinGecko (see photo below).

# Troubleshooting

Some people have had errors on a clean install of Rasbian Lite on Pi. If you do, run:

```
sudo apt-get install libopenjp2-7
sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
```

and re-run the script.

If the unit is freezing, try switching to another power supply.
